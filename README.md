# Loan Form
This mimi project serves as a practical example of how to handle form inputs and state management in a simple React application. This mini loan form project demonstrates the use of the `useState` hook in **React** to manage form data. 
The `useState` hook is used to keep track of the current values entered in each input field, enabling dynamic updates to the form and potentially allowing for real-time calculations or validations as the user types.
